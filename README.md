# cctetris
Very simple tetris game I made in over the last couple days in c++ as OOP practice  
It's quite limited since I don't know all that much about X11 (Event-driven, can't make it run without user input)  
But it has scoring, detects lines and lets you move pieces as you would expect in tetris
